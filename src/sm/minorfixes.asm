; During horizontal door transitions, the "ready for NMI" flag is set by IRQ at the bottom of the door as an optimisation,
; but the PLM drawing routine hasn't necessarily finished processing yet.
; The Kraid quick kill vomit happens because NMI actually interrupts the PLM drawing routine for the PLM that clears the spike floor,
; *whilst* it's in the middle of writing entries to the $D0 table, which the NMI processes.

; This fix simply clears this NMI-ready flag for the duration of the PLM drawing routine.
; Place this into the freespace after the free space used by items.asm
